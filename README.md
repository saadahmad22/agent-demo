2. **Safe Agent** - Added user confirmations for all actions  
3. **Smart Agent** - Conditional interrupts for sensitive operations only
4. **Specialized Agent** - Domain-specific workflows for complex processes

### Key Technologies

- **LangGraph** - Graph-based AI workflow orchestration

### `demo.ipynb` - Main Tutorial Notebook

The primary learning resource containing four progressive tutorials:

**Part 1: Simple Zero-shot Agent**
- Basic assistant with direct tool execution
- No safety checks or confirmations
- Demonstrates core LangGraph concepts

**Part 2: Adding User Confirmations** 
- Enhanced safety with user approval required for ALL actions
- Interrupt-based workflow control
- Better error handling and context management

**Part 3: Smart Conditional Interrupts**
- Intelligent decision-making about when to interrupt
- Safe operations (search) proceed automatically
- Sensitive operations (booking) require approval

**Part 4: Specialized Workflows** *(Educational framework provided)*
- Architecture for domain-specific assistant workflows
- Production deployment patterns
- Advanced error handling and recovery

### `llm_integration.py` - LLM Integration Module

A comprehensive wrapper for interacting with language models through Replicate:

#### Key Classes and Functions:

**`ReplitLLM` Class**
- Main interface for language model interactions
- Handles authentication and model configuration
- Manages conversation history and context

**Core Methods:**

1. **`__init__(api_key, model)`**
    - Initializes LLM with API credentials
    - Sets up default model configuration
    - Configures environment variables

2. **`prompt_for_api_key()`**
    - Interactive API key setup
    - Validates credentials
    - Provides user-friendly setup experience

3. **`generate_response(prompt, system_prompt, conversation_history, temperature, max_tokens, tools_available)`**
    - Main response generation method
    - Handles tool integration and calling
    - Manages conversation context and history
    - Returns structured response with content and tool calls

4. **`_init_llm()`**
    - Internal method to initialize Replicate LLM instance
    - Handles connection errors gracefully
    - Sets model parameters

5. **`_parse_response_with_tools(raw_response, tools_available)`**
    - Parses LLM responses to extract tool calls
    - Separates natural language from function calls
    - Handles multiple tool call formats
    - Generates natural language descriptions for tool usage

6. **`_parse_tool_args(args_str)`**
    - Extracts and validates tool arguments
    - Handles type conversion (strings, numbers, booleans)
    - Supports both quoted and unquoted parameters

7. **`_generate_tool_description(tool_name, args)`**
    - Creates human-readable descriptions of tool actions
    - Provides context-aware explanations
    - Enhances user experience with clear communication

### Supporting Components

**Database Tools (`demo.ipynb` cells)**
- `setup_database()` - Downloads and configures travel booking database
- `search_flights()` - Searches available flights
- `search_hotels()` - Finds hotel accommodations
- `book_hotel()` - Makes hotel reservations
- `book_car_rental()` - Books car rentals
- `cancel_booking()` - Cancels existing reservations
- `lookup_policy()` - Retrieves company policies
- `fetch_user_flight_information()` - Gets user's current bookings

**Web Search Integration**
- `FreeWebSearch` class - Integrates DuckDuckGo search
- `web_search_tool()` - Provides web search capabilities

**Assistant Classes**
- `SimpleAssistant` - Basic tool-calling agent
- `SafeAssistant` - Enhanced agent with user context and safety

### Graph-Based Workflow

The project uses LangGraph to create stateful, graph-based AI workflows:

```
User Input ‚Üí Context Loading ‚Üí AI Processing ‚Üí Tool Execution ‚Üí Response
      ‚Üë                                              ‚Üì
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ User Approval ‚Üê Safety Check ‚Üê Tool Analysis
```

### State Management

Each conversation maintains:
- **Message History** - Full conversation context
- **User Information** - Current bookings and preferences  
- **Tool Results** - Outputs from database and web searches
- **Approval Status** - User confirmations for actions

### Safety Mechanisms

1. **Universal Interrupts** (Part 2) - Pause before any tool execution
2. **Conditional Interrupts** (Part 3) - Smart decisions about when to pause
3. **User Approval Flow** - Clear confirmation requests
4. **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling of failures
